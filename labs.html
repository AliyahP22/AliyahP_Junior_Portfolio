		 <h1>End of Unit Labs</h1>
	      <h3>Lab 1: Silly Sentences</h3>
		 <p>Silly Sentences was the first lab we did on a platform called Project Stem. The goal of this lab was for the user to input their words of choice
		  and the output would create a fun story!!

	      <h3>Lab 2: Calculating Room Area</h3>
		<p>Calculating room area, which was the second lab completed on project stem, was a review on using float and integer data types to create a program to 
			solve a math problem! Users can input the numbers given or any numbers they choose and the program will calculate the area and present it to the user!

		<h3>Lab 3: Chatbot</h3>
		 <p>Chatbot, which was the third and one of my favorite labs I have done this year on project stem is a review on using if statements and if else statements. 
		 Using the random feature and if statements, I created a fashion bot that would have a conversation with the user and based on their responses, would output a 
		 different response each time!

		 <h3>Lab 4: Divisible by 3</h3>
		 <p>Divisible by 3, which is the 4th lab completed on project stem is a user controlled program that checks if your numbers are divisible by 3 or not divisible
		 by 3. Users would be able to input how many numbers they would like to check and using loops, the program would run that amount of times, checking each number individually and
		informing if it is divisble or not. At the end of the program, it would output the total amount of numbers divisble by 3 and the total of numbers that are not divisible by 3.
