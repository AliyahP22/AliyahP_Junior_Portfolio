	      <h3>CFU 1</h3>
	      <p>CFU 1, which was our first ever check for understanding was a review on the concepts of using user input. In this CFU, 
	      users would input their first name and last name, and the program would output hello and their name
	      </p>

      		<h3>CFU 2</h3>
	        <p>CFU 2, similar to CFU 1, is a review of using user input in a program to output a sentence. Users can input their first name,
		last name, their age, and they would respond to the prompt'how long have you been coding'. Based on what the user inputs, 
		the output would print hello with their name, age and the response to the prompt.
		</p>

	      	<h3>CFU 3</h3>
	       <p>In CFU 3, I did a basic review of user inputs and using the skills I learned about numerical operators,I created a program where
		the user inputs their first and last name, which would output a greeting to them, and they will input a whole number and a decimal number.
		Using those 2 values, the program will calculate the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder and print out each value to the user.
	       </p>

	         <h3>CFU 4</h3>
	         <p>In CFU 4, I created a program where the user can input 3 numbers of their choice and the program will calculate the roots 
                 of their equation using the quadratic formula using import math from the python library.

	          <h3>CFU 5</h3>
	      <p>In CFU 5, I created a program using user input of integers that converts canadian money to US money, and then returns the amount of money in a print statement. This code uses inputs from user and a formula that was contained in variables</p>

	          <h3>CFU 6</h3>
	      <p>In CFU 6, I created a program in which the user has to put in a number(user input) and using import random, a new number is generated and my program does basic math calculations and returns the answers.</p>

	           <h3>CFU 7</h3>
	      <p>In CFU 7, using user inputs, the user is able to input 2 numbers of their choice and my program will calculate and return the sum and the average of those 2 numbers. </p>

	           <h3>CFU 8</h3>
	      <p>In CFU 8, I did a mini review about python functions, conditionals, if statements and else if statements. My program basically has a conversation with the user using conditional statements</p>

	           <h3>CFU 9</h3>
	      <p>CFU 9 is a program using import random and if statements. We are basically creating a game where the user can 
#select how many rolls they want, with each roll, a random number would be selected and the user must guess 
#what the number is. </p>

	           <h3>CFU 10</h3>
	      <p>CFU 10 generates a random number and using conditional statements and functions, creates a guessing game in which the user has to interact with the program and guess the number that was randomly generated</p>

	           <h3>CFU 11</h3>
	      <p>CFU 11,  which is an introduction to loops and range. the first task is a loop that prints a number sequence 10-70. Option 2 is a decimal number sequence. Option 3 is the 99 bottles of beer on the wall song. Using 
functions, the user can pick what option they want. </p>

	           <h3>CFU 12</h3>
	      <p>CFU 12, which has a set password, allows users to keep guessing until they get the right password. This program uses while loops</p>
